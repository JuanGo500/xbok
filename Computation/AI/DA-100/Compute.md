# Compute

- **Compute instances**: virtual machine in the cloud, managed by the workspace. Ideal to run (Jupyter) notebooks.

- **Compute clusters**: On-demand clusters of CPU or GPU compute nodes in the cloud, managed by the workspace. Ideal for production workloads as they  scale.

- **Kubernetes clusters**: Allows you to create or attach an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Ideal to deploy trained machine learning models in production scenarios.
- **Attached computes**: Allows you to attach other Azure compute resources to the workspace, like Azure Databricks or Synapse Spark pools.

- **Serverless compute**: A fully managed, on-demand compute you can use for training jobs.
