## 1. What is Work

### The Cycle of Growth

The cycle of growth is a pattern that is observed in the relationship between Conscience, Material Reality and Information Domain.

- **Action** is effected change that tries to fulfill a purpose.
- **Data** is information about an action.
- **Conscience** is the generation of purpose based on data.

### Definition of Work
Work is a type of action governed by a program.

A program is any type of design-time _course of action_ description.

A workload is the work performed by a work agent.

A work agent is a human or machine capable of performing work.

### Types of workload
- communication: hear, speak, agree
- analysis: read, consolidate, explain
- design: research, solve, plan
- physical interaction: provision, make, control

## 2. How to organize work?

The atomic parts of a workload are CPU instructions (machine) or neuronal synapsis (human).

There are two main reasons to group atomic instructions in higher level sets.
- Understanding: we may group to understand better the efficacy or effectiveness of the work.
- Motivating: we want to increase the motivation of human agents towards the purpose that the work is meant to achieve.

One good way to organize work is using the minimal relevant change of component state.
- **component state**: we are not interested in energy flow but in final state. At the atomic level, efficacy is more important than efficiency.
- **minimal relevant change**: a simple change is easier to achieve than a complex change. But the change needs to have a meaning. It has to be relevant to a human observer.
