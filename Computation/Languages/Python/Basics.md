# Python basics

## Idiosyncratic
- Indented spaces (typically 4) instead of braces



## Variables
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.```x=1```
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- It is possible to assign multiple values ```x, y = "Orange", "Banana"```
- A constant has all letters in uppercase

## Types
- Numbers (int, float, complex): x = 10 
- Strings (str): string = "Hello World" 
- Structures 
    - Lists: list = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
    - Tuples: tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4) 
    - Sets and frozensets: set = {1, 2, 3, 4} 
    - Dictionaries: dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
    - Range: 
- Boolean: is_valid = True 
- NoneType: nothing = None
- Memory:
    - Binary: binary = 0b1010
    - byte
    - bytearray
    - memoryview

- get the data type ```type(object)```
