## Definitions

Time: is a computational progresion of applying update rules
Energy: is the flux of casual edges through space like hyper surfaces
Mass: part of energy that does not correspond to pieces communicating with other part of the hypergraph

Universe is finite dimensional

Energy is the flux of causal edges through space-like surfaces

Energy is the communication of activity in the network through time
Momentum is the communication of activity in the network through space
Mass: propensity of activity to not be transmitted to other part of the network
