# Combinatorics

## Ordering
Change the position of objects in one set.

### Permutations
A permutation is an ordering of objects in a set.
One permutation is different from another by the position of elements.

$$ P_n = n! $$
 
### Permutations of groups
A permutation of all the elements divided by the permutation of elements in each group.

$$ \text{P with groups}=\frac{P_n}{\prod_{i=1}^{k} i!}
 $$

## Selections

### Variations

$$ V(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} $$


Permutations of all elements divided by the permutations of non-selected elements.
