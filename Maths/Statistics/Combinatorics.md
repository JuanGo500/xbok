# Combinatorics

## Transformations on objects
Change the position of objects in one set.

### Permutations
A permutation is an ordering of objects in a set.
One permutation is different from another by the position of elements.
 


## Selections

### Variations

$$ V(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} $$


Permutations of all elements divided by the permutations of non-selected elements.
