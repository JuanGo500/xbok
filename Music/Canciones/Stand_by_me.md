## Letra

    A
    When the night has come 
    and the land is dark 
    And the moon is the only
    light we'll see

    A
    No I won't be afraid,
    no I won't be afraid 
    Just as long as you stand,  
    stand by me. So darlin', darlin'
    
    A
    If the sky that we look upon
    should tumble and fall
    And the mountain
    should crumble
    to the sea

    A
    I won't cry,
    I won't cry,
    no I won't shed a tear
    Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

    B
    So darling, darling
    stand by me, oh now stand by me,  
    stand by me, stand by me.
