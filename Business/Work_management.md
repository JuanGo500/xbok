# Work

The purpose of this section is to define work and to describe a good practice to organize it.

## The cycle of agency

The cycle of agency is a pattern that is observed in the interaction of an agent with the world across Physics, Information and Conscience domains.

An agent is an entity that can perceive internal and external states, can create representations of those states and can act to change those states.

- **Action** is a change realized by an agent that tries to fulfill a purpose.

- **Information** is the representation of an action and its effects.

- **Conscience** is the generation of purpose based on information.

Primitive types of actions are:

- Perceive
- Think
- Move


## Definition of work

Work is a 

type of action governed by a program.

A program is any type of design-time _course of action_ statement.

## Workloads

Workloads are instances of work performed by a work agent.

A work agent is a human or machine capable of performing work.

### Types of workloads

#### Physical oriented

- provision
- make
- control

#### Information oriented

- perceive
- model
- explain

#### Decision oriented

- evaluate
- decide
- plan

## How to organize work?

### Workloads

The atomic parts of a workload are CPU instructions (machine) or neuronal synapsis (human).

There are two main reasons to group atomic instructions in higher level sets:

- Understanding: we may group to understand better the efficacy or effectiveness of the work.

- Motivating: we want to increase the motivation of human agents towards the purpose that the work is meant to achieve.

One good way to organize work is using the minimal relevant change of component state.

- **component state**: we are not interested in energy flow but in final state. At the atomic level, efficacy is more important than efficiency.

- **minimal relevant change**: a simple change is easier to achieve than a complex change. But the change needs to have a meaning. It has to be relevant to a human observer.
