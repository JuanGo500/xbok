# Wolfram Physics

# Science models
- Structural: in the antiquity people looked for structures without reference to time.
- Mathematical: since 1600 physical phenomena are described through mathematical equations. Time is another variable.
- Simple computational: there is a computation of states. Time updates the states.
- Multiway computational: the updates can happen in more than one way. The flow of states is threaded.

# Computational irreducibility
A system is computationally irreducible when you cannot know the state of a system if you don't apply a sequencial computation.

# Observer computational boundness
An observer of th system that is part of the computational hypergraph.


## Definitions

- Time: is a computational progresion of update rules
- Energy: is the flux of casual edges through space-like hypersurfaces. Energy is the communication of activity in the network through time
- Momentum is the communication of activity in the network through space
- Mass: part of energy that does not correspond to pieces communicating with other part of the hypergraph. Mass: propensity of activity to not be transmitted to other part of the network

Universe is finite dimensional
