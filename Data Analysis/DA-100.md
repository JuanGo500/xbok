# Exam DA - 100: Analyzing Data with Microsoft Power BI

## Skills Measured

### Audience Profile
Data Analysts enable businesses to maximize the value of their data assets by using Microsoft Power BI.

As a subject matter expert, data analysts are responsible for designing and building scalable data models, cleaning and transforming data, and enabling advanced analytic capabilities that provide meaningful business value through easy - to - comprehend data visualizations. 

Data analysts also collaborate with key stakeholders across verticals to deliver relevant insights based on identified business requirements.

The Data Analyst should have a fundamental understanding of data repositories and data processing both on - premises and in the cloud.

### Skills Measured

NOTE: The bullets that appear below each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how
we are assessing that skill. This list is not definitive or exhaustive.

NOTE: In most cases, exams do NOT cover preview features, and some features will only be
added to an exam when they are GA (General Availability).
